 * - Trigger lifecycle stages for extensions
 * - Trigger lifecycle stages for domains (all extensions)
 * - Trigger lifecycle stages for domains themselves
 * - Execute lifecycle hook action chains
 *
 * Key Benefits:
 * - Dependency Inversion: ScreensetsRegistry depends on abstraction
 * - Testability: Can inject mock managers for testing
 * - Encapsulation: Execution logic is hidden in concrete class
