 * Abstract container provider -- contract for domain container management.

 * Each extension domain has a ContainerProvider that supplies the DOM
 * container element for mounting extensions. This shifts container
 * management from the action caller to the domain, making mount_ext
 * payloads pure data (no DOM references).
 *
 * Concrete implementations:
 * - RefContainerProvider (@hai3/react) wraps a React ref for React-rendered domains
 * - Custom domains can provide their own implementations
 *
 * Exported from @hai3/screensets for consumer implementations.
