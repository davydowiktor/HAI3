 * encapsulate the actual storage mechanism.
 *
 * Key Benefits:
 * - Dependency Inversion: ScreensetsRegistry depends on abstraction, not concrete implementation
 * - Testability: Can inject mock coordinators for testing
 * - Encapsulation: Storage mechanism is hidden in concrete class
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * class ScreensetsRegistry {
 *   private readonly coordinator: RuntimeCoordinator;
 *
 *   constructor(config: ScreensetsRegistryConfig) {
 *     this.coordinator = config.coordinator ?? new WeakMapRuntimeCoordinator();
 *   }
