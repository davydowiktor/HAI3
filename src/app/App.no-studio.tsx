/**
 * HAI3 Application Component (Legacy Variant - No Studio)
 *
 * NOTE: This is a legacy template variant. The active App.tsx uses MFE system.
 * This variant still uses the legacy AppRouter pattern and needs migration to
 * MFE-based screen loading (see App.tsx for the MFE implementation).
 *
 * Renders the Layout with AppRouter for screen navigation.
 * Layout components are generated by `hai3 scaffold layout` and owned by the project.
 *
 * HAI3Provider (in main.tsx) handles:
 * - Redux Provider setup
 * - HAI3 context (app instance)
 *
 * Layout handles:
 * - Header, Menu, Footer, Sidebar rendering
 * - Theme-aware styling via hooks
 *
 * AppRouter handles:
 * - Screen lazy loading
 * - Navigation state
