# Shared Utilities

This directory contains shared utilities, hooks, and styles used across multiple screens in the demo MFE:

- **i18n helpers**: Hooks and utilities for MFE-local internationalization
- **common hooks**: Custom React hooks shared across screens
- **shared styles**: Common style utilities and helpers

These utilities are internal to the demo-mfe package and enable code reuse between the 4 screen entries.
